Playing Around with Device APIs

I first learned about the device APIs back in February when Tim Wright wrote, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/environmental-design-with-the-device-api">Environmental Design with the Device API</a>. Ever since then I've been wanting to learn more and play around a bit with them. Unfortunately not all of the proposed features have been implemented and on top of that it looks like Firefox OS and Firefox for Android are the only ones to have begun implementation. This is understandable since at the time of this writing the device APIs are still a W3C draft.

If your interested in seeing a working demo, you can see it <a href="http://jeffdevelops.com/local/device/">here</a>
