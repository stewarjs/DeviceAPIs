Playing Around with Device APIs

I first learned about the device APIs back in February when Tim Wright wrote, <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/environmental-design-with-the-device-api">Environmental Design with the Device API</a>. Ever since then I've been wanting to learn more and play around a bit with them. Unfortunately not all of the proposed features have been implemented and on top of that it looks like Firefox OS and Firefox for Android are the only ones to have begun implementation. This is understandable since at the time of this writing the device APIs are still a W3C draft.

Below I've listed the working group that is responsible for creating the client-side APIs as well as the few APIs I've chosen to try. The dashboard on this page will display the results.

For more information on the working group, the APIs showcased here and the source code, please see the links at the bottom of this page.
